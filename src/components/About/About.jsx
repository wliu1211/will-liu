          <p>My history with coding started when the COVID pandemic hit in 2020. I started making websites out of curiosity and eventually wanted to explore more of the computer science field at a university. I am currently an undergraduate student at NYU Tandon studying computer science. I am expected to graduate in 2025. After graduating, I am planning to master in computer vision.</p>
